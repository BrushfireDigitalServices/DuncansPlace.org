	<h2>Welcome! Our website is currently under renovation.</h2>
	<p>Duncan’s Place is a non-profit organization dedicated to aiding homeless cats in Northern Colorado. We provide compassionate, safe havens for homeless cats through foster care until their forever homes are found.</p>

	<p>We also endeavour to provide the Northern Colorado community with humane education and resources such as our pet food bank to help humans and felines live harmoniously together. Duncan’s Place feels that we need to approach animal welfare issues on multiple fronts, bringing together community resources and providing not only animal care, but also pet sterilization and public education.</p>
	
	<p>We rely heavily on private donations to house and save domestic cats in need.</p>
